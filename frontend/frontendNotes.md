#Frontend Notes

## Apollo Client
Apollo client is essentially used to connect to the yoga server.
1. You create an Apollo client first (withData.js)
2. The withData takes the withApollo (next-with-apollo for server side renders) and takes the client.
3. The app (_app.js) is passed into the withData function, which is the withApollo func, using the apollo client.
4. Inside the _app, you wrap the Page components in the ApolloProvider and pass all the page props as a descructured object so you can access all the data that Apollo gets (from the yoga server, which uses GraphQL to query the Prisma server ðŸ¤¯).
